Important Notes

- After switching to a new voice, you must click Process Text & Generate Audio again for the change to take effect

- If you encounter "missing DLL" errors on Windows: Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (64-bit)

- The tool requires an internet connection for the first use (to initialize TTS engine)

- Avoid inputting extremely long texts (over 1000 characters) for better performance

Troubleshooting

- Audio not playing: Check if your system volume is muted; try restarting the tool

- App crashes on launch: Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements; re-download the latest version from Releases

- Slow processing: Reduce text length or close other heavy applications
